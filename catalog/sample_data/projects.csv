Memorials and Landscaping,Australian Memorial Wellington NZ,DTZ,3000000,1/03/2015,"Manteena was engaged by DTZ as the Head Contractor to deliver the construction of The Australian Memorial in Wellington NZ. The memorial commemorates the long and close relationship between the people of Australia and New Zealand, and in particular, our shared Anzac experience of war. It comprises 15 columns, each 6m tall and arranged in an open array on a surface of red sandstone and dark grey basalt. The Memorial's dominant material  'rugged red sandstone' is instantly recognisable as an image of Australia. The panel in the central column is inscribed with the word 'Anzac'. Seven more columns bear the names of the principal theatres and operations in which Australian and New Zealand forces served alongside one another. The remaining seven panels include the inscriptions of Maori and Aboriginal artworks representing a series of significant themes related to the memorials intent ? the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art from the Balarinji Design Studio and Maori art by Jacob Scott. The Maori artworks are a way of connecting the Australian memorial to the site, place and people of New Zealand. These are balanced by the Indigenous Australian works carrying cultural messages about rituals and artefacts. Placing the designs together within the landscape symbolises the New Zealand and Australian relationship, the links between the two providing strength and unification."
